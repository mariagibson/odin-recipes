            <p>I scooped small balls and flattened them out a little bc the dough was too dry to roll out. The cookie stay pretty moist but the outside began to overcook prior to the interior being dried out. Left in oven another 10-15 minutes; still no cronch, but tasting. Icing set well, could bag. The moisture content in this batch would require refrigeration, as they mold within a few days if left at roomn temp.
